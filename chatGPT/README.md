Some scripts I asked chatGPT to write to get an idea how useful it might or might not be for that. 

I think it may be useful for a certain class of things that are simple but maybe not that familiar. 
Like I don't use Groovy tablesaw or Julia every day so having it generate some starter code is a good 
jupstart for working with that.  It's like having a tutorial generator that generates a tutorial 
to your spec rather than the random problem someone might have used for a tutorial online. 

When I tried to have it do more complicated things, though, it would sometimes get confused with
the logic.  And when I tried to have it write some deep learning code for me it was useful to 
see the code as an example of the sort of thing required but the code was very buggy, mostly because
the APIs that it used were now deprecated or changed so that the code it generated was not 
compatible with any recent version of the library.
