Plots.jl
Supposedly early entry that maybe lacking in usability.  
It's just an interface for other software.   Often Python software. 

GadFly.jl 
Pretty slow start up, like 40s.  Need to see how much is RDatasets, etc. 
Plots are nice. 
Their description of their jupyter support is more encouraging. 
Integration with DataFrames.jl 
Supports some interactive visualization. 

VegaLite
Startup is 10s, which feels slow but also feels survivable whereas 40s does not 
feel survivable.
